BF_mo_04_leaf: Ca, K, Mg negative
BF_mo_06_leaf: looks fine; keep values (marked violet in 
	<MicrowaveExtract_PBoct15.xls>)
BF_lo_14_leaf: Mn is H in micro -> take value from macro
CI_tb_20_leaf: for Mn take value from macro dilution (H) 
	-> rep 1, rep 2, and rep 3
CI_sb_16_leaf: Na has H value (5180H)
CI_sb_20_leaf: Mn is H (take from macro dilution) -> rep 1 and 2;
	rep 3 is very low in both micro and macro run 
	(no H in micro) -> take value from macro run (consistency)
